    "#Q1. What is the difference between __getattr__ and __getattribute__?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"The __getattr__ and __getattribute__ methods in Python are both used for attribute access in classes, but they have some \n",
    "   important differences.\n",
    "   \n",
    "     1. __getattr__:\n",
    "\n",
    "        . __getattr__ is a fallback method that gets called when an attribute is accessed and not found through the normal \n",
    "          lookup process.\n",
    "          \n",
    "        . It is only called when the attribute is not present in the instance's dictionary (__dict__).\n",
    "        \n",
    "        . If __getattr__ is defined in a class, it is invoked whenever any attribute that is not found by normal lookup is\n",
    "          accessed. \n",
    "          \n",
    "        . __getattr__ receives the name of the attribute as a parameter and can return a value or raise an AttributeError \n",
    "          if the attribute is not found. \n",
    "          \n",
    "    2. __getattribute__:\n",
    "\n",
    "       . __getattribute__ is a more general method that is called for every attribute access, regardless of whether the \n",
    "         attribute is present or not.\n",
    "         \n",
    "       . It is invoked before checking the instance's dictionary for the attribute, even if the attribute exists. \n",
    "       \n",
    "       . If __getattribute__ is defined in a class, it is called for all attribute access, including the ones that \n",
    "         are present in the instance's dictionary.\n",
    "         \n",
    "       . Care should be taken while implementing __getattribute__ to avoid infinite recursion by using super().__getattribute__\n",
    "         () to access attributes defined in parent classes.\n",
    "         \n",
    " In summary, __getattr__ is called when an attribute is not found through the normal lookup process, while__getattribute__ \n",
    " is called for every attribute access.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q2. What is the difference between properties and descriptors?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Both properties and descriptors in Python provide a way to define attributes with customized access and assignment behavior, \n",
    "   but they have some key differences:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Properties:\n",
    "   \n",
    "      . Properties are a convenient way to add custom access and assignment behavior to an attribute.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      . Properties are defined at the class level as methods decorated with @property, @<attribute>.getter, @<attribute>.\n",
    "        setter, or @<attribute>.deleter.\n",
    "        \n",
    "      . Properties are accessed and assigned using the attribute name directly, without any explicit method calls.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      . Properties are defined per attribute and allow customizing only the access, assignment, or deletion behavior of that \n",
    "        specific attribute.\n",
    "        \n",
    "      . Properties are primarily used to provide controlled access to an attribute while maintaining backward compatibility \n",
    "        with existing code that accesses the attribute directly.\n",
    "        \n",
    "      . Properties can be overridden in subclasses to provide different behavior.  \n",
    "      \n",
    "  Descriptors:\n",
    "  \n",
    "      . Descriptors are objects that define how attribute access is handled.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      . Descriptors are defined as classes implementing at least one of the descriptor methods: __get__, __set__, or \n",
    "        __delete__.\n",
    "        \n",
    "      . Descriptors are assigned to class attributes directly.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      . Descriptors can be shared among multiple attributes or classes.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      . Descriptors can control the access, assignment, or deletion behavior for multiple attributes or even for all \n",
    "        attributes of a class.\n",
    "        \n",
    "      . Descriptors can provide additional functionality beyond attribute access, such as computed attributes, type \n",
    "        validation, or caching.\n",
    "        \n",
    "      . Descriptors are typically used when you need to customize attribute behavior that is shared across multiple \n",
    "        attributes or when you want to define more complex attribute interactions.\n",
    "        \n",
    "   In summary, properties provide a simpler and more straightforward way to customize the access and assignment behavior of \n",
    "   specific attributes, while descriptors offer a more powerful and flexible mechanism to control attribute access, allowing\n",
    "   behavior customization across multiple attributes or classes.\"\"\"\n",

    "#Q3. What are the key differences in functionality between __getattr__ and __getattribute__, as well as\n",
    "properties and descriptors?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"The key differences in functionality between __getattr__ and __getattribute__, as well as properties and descriptors, \n",
    "   lie in how they handle attribute access in Python. Let's examine each of them individually:\n",
    "   \n",
    "     1. __getattr__:\n",
    "        \n",
    "         . __getattr__ is a special method that gets called when an attribute lookup fails using the usual methods \n",
    "           (i.e., when an attribute is not found).\n",
    "           \n",
    "         . It takes a single parameter, the name of the attribute being accessed.\n",
    "         \n",
    "         . This method can be used to dynamically compute and return the value of the requested attribute or raise an \n",
    "           AttributeError if the attribute does not exist.\n",
    "           \n",
    "        . It is only called when the attribute is not found through the usual attribute lookup process.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    2. __getattribute__:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        . __getattribute__ is another special method that gets called for every attribute access, regardless of whether \n",
    "          the attribute is present or not.\n",
    "          \n",
    "         . It is used to implement attribute access interception, allowing you to customize attribute access behavior.\n",
    "         \n",
    "         .This method takes a single parameter, the name of the attribute being accessed.\n",
    "         \n",
    "         . If you define __getattribute__, it will be called for all attribute accesses, so you need to be careful to avoid \n",
    "           infinite recursion by delegating attribute accesses to the base class using super().__getattribute__(name).\n",
    "           \n",
    "   3. Properties:\n",
    "   \n",
    "         . Properties are a way to define methods that are accessed like attributes. They provide a convenient way to\n",
    "           implement getter, setter, and deleter methods for attribute access.\n",
    "           \n",
    "        . Properties allow you to define computed attributes or add additional logic when accessing or modifying an attribute.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        . Properties are defined using the @property decorator on a method, which is then accessed as an attribute.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        . They are useful when you want to provide a clean interface for attribute access while maintaining control over \n",
    "          the underlying data.\n",
    "          \n",
    "   4. Descriptors:\n",
    "   \n",
    "        . Descriptors are objects that define the behavior of attribute access.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        . They allow you to customize attribute access at the class level rather than the instance level.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        . Descriptors implement the __get__, __set__, and __delete__ methods, which define the behavior for getting, setting, \n",
    "          and deleting an attribute, respectively.\n",
    "          \n",
    "        . By using descriptors, you can define attributes that exhibit custom behavior when accessed, providing fine-grained \n",
    "          control over attribute access.\n",
    "          \n",
    "     In summary, the key differences are:\n",
    "\n",
    "       . __getattr__ is called when an attribute is not found through the usual lookup process, whereas __getattribute__ \n",
    "          is called for every attribute access, regardless of existence.\n",
